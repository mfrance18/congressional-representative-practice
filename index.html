            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p class="biography">Tennesseans in the state's Fourth Congressional District first elected Scott DesJarlais<br>
                to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010. He is currently serving his sixth term in Congress.

            <p class="biography">In Washington, Congressman DesJarlais has built a reputation as a conservative leader.
                He is consistently rated as one of the most effective conservatives in Congress<br> by groups like Heritage,
                the American Conservative Union and Americans for Prosperity. Additionally, Congressman DesJarlais has
                received an “A” rating<br> from the National Rifle Association, and an “A” rating from Numbers USA, a
                leading organization seeking to stop illegal immigration.</p>

            <p class="biography">Congressman DesJarlais has a proven track record of fighting for policies that will
                enforce fiscal discipline in Washington, strengthen our nation’s economy, and end<br> the flow of illegal
                immigration. While in Congress he has voted to cut income taxes and wasteful spending, balance the
                budget, repeal ObamaCare, and reform the food stamp<br> program to help Tennesseans gain employment.</p>

            <p class="biography">Congressman DesJarlais’ legislation allowing members of the military to carry firearms

                the lives of four U.S. Marines and a sailor, became law in 2016.</p>

                his constituents. These are:</p>

                    Committee on Agriculture</a></p>

            <p class="biography">Congressman DesJarlais is also a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, as
                well as the GOP Doctors Caucus and Border Security Caucus.</p>

            <p class="biography">Congressman DesJarlais earned degrees in Chemistry and Psychology and a Doctorate of
